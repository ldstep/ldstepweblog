> Why do you run a blog? Is it to make a living, or is it a hobby? If you write from your small corner of the internet for pleasure, to meet new people, or simply for engagement, then you probably shouldn’t ask for money for it. Here's why:

> First, asking for donations creates an implicit transaction, even when framed as "optional". Readers may feel entitled to certain topics, frequency, or opinions.
> 
> Second, financial incentives often (if not always) influence behavior. Writers may unconsciously avoid controversial opinions, difficult topics, or experimental ideas out of fear of alienating supporters. This certainly leads to self-censorship, where authenticity is sacrificed in favor of maintaining income. There are many examples of this among content creators out there.

> Third, the barrier to entry for blogging has never been lower. Today, there are countless ways to build an online presence, and running a blog can cost little to nothing. When the costs of running a blog are minimal or nonexistent, requesting money becomes harder to justify, especially for a purely personal website.

> Finally, without financial pressure, writers are free to write irregularly, change direction, or even stop altogether. At least, that is how I feel about this blog.

_For my own site_, I agree in principle.

A personal blog, for me, is my space where I share how I'm using my tech, random thoughts, and the occasional rant. I don't want to feel obligated to produce posts, stick to specific topics, or maintain consistency. Even optional donations can alter that dynamic, at least in my own mind.

Blogging isn't expensive anymore. A domain and basic hosting cost very little, and I'm happy to cover that expense myself.

I appreciate that my blog doesn't have to perform. It doesn't need to grow or justify its existence. It can be valuable to a few people, or just to me.

What are your thoughts?
