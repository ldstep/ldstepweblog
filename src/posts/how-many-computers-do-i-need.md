> Having a laptop again has reminded me of how nice they are in terms of flexibility and portability. Yet I also like the desktop’s power and ease of repairs and upgrades. But analyzing my tech use after obtaining a laptop, the only things I use my desktop for on a regular basis are light gaming (dedicated graphics) and data storage (2 TB HDD). Everything else – writing, communication, web browsing, etc. I prefer to do on my laptop.

Reading this prompted me to get busy and sell my desktop Mac. Like Dallin, I’ve been using an M1 iMac desktop recently and now have a laptop (M1 MacBook Air) again. Since getting the Air my iMac has sat unused except for on a couple of occasions. I do my writing, communication, web browsing, etc. on my laptop as well.

That said, I’ve been vacillating on selling my iMac. Realistically I just don’t need it. I have a quote to sell my iMac from [Sell Your Mac](https://www.sellyourmac.com/), so yesterday I reset and packed up it up ready for drop-off at our local UPS Store.

Here’s my current hardware stack:

-   iPhone 11
-   M1 MacBook Air
-   iPad Air 4th Generation with Magic Keyboard
-   Apple Watch 44 mm Series 4
-   Kindle Paperwhite
