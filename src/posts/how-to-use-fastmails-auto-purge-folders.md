[Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057) has folders that can auto-purge emails? This feature lets you automatically delete messages from a folder after a certain amount of time. I’ve found it to be a great way to manage notification emails that I want to keep for a while, but not forever.

Here’a how to set up an auto-purge folder:

1.  Go to the **Settings** page in Fastmail.
2.  Click on the **Folders** tab.
3.  Find the folder that you want to set up auto-purge for.
4.  Click on the **Edit** button.
5.  Scroll down to the **Automated Actions** section.
6.  Check the box next to **Auto-purge this folder on a selected date**.
7.  Select the number of days after which you want the messages to be deleted.
8.  Click on the **Save** button.

That’s it! Once you’ve set up a folder with auto-purge, any messages that are older than the specified number of days will be automatically deleted.
