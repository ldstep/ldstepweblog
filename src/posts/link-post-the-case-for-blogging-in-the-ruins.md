[Joan Westenberg](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-case-for-blogging-in-the-ruins/)

> Start a blog. Start one because the practice of writing at length, for an audience you respect, about things that matter to you, is itself valuable. Start one because owning your own platform is a form of independence that becomes more important as centralized platforms become less trustworthy. Start one because the format shapes the thought, and this format is good for thinking.
