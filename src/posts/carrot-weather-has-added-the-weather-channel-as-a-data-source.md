Last October, I [wrote](https://ldstephens.net/posts/carrot-weathers-limited-weather-sources/) about Carrot Weather's limited data sources. In that post, I mentioned my love for Carrot Weather, but noted that the available weather sources weren't accurate for central New Jersey, and that The Weather Channel and Weatherbit were the most reliable sources for my region. I was even considering not renewing my subscription, but ultimately decided to do so.

The developer of Carrot Weather had been hinting at an update for the last few days, so I checked for it this morning. To my great joy, version 6.4 now includes The Weather Channel as a data source, giving me both the best weather app and the most accurate weather data.

Speaking of the weather, the Blizzard of 2026, as we're calling it, dumped close to 30 inches of snow on us Sunday and Monday.
