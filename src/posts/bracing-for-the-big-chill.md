It's really fucking cold this morning. The temperature is currently 11 degrees, with a wind chill of -3. A major storm is expected tomorrow, bringing snow, sleet, and ice. We spent yesterday preparing for it. I checked the heating oil, and we have plenty. I'll bring in a good supply of firewood this afternoon.
