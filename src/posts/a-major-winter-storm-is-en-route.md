Fun, fun, fun! For the first time in over a month, the snow has melted enough that I can actually see the yard. Now, we're getting another storm.

A powerful nor'easter is heading toward New Jersey, and my town is right in its path. The National Weather Service has issued a Blizzard Warning as well.

Tomorrow, Sunday, will start with rain, but it's expected to switch to snow by mid-morning. The worst conditions are forecast for Sunday night into Monday morning, when heavy snow and strong winds could reduce visibility to near zero. By Monday afternoon, the heaviest snow should begin to taper off, but gusty winds are expected to continue, causing drifting snow.

Current estimates are for 6–10 inches of snow, with some spots reaching 12 inches, and wind gusts of 30–40 mph. The Blizzard Warning is in effect from 10:00 AM Sunday through 6:00 PM Monday, with possible whiteout conditions.

This looks like a pretty serious storm, so I spent the day getting prepared.
