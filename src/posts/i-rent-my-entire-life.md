I came across [this piece](https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-rent-my-entire-life/) by Greg Morris today and it's been rattling around in my head ever since. It's about something most of us don't think about until it's too late the fact that almost nothing in our digital lives is truly ours anymore. Music, photos, software, writing it's all rented. Give it a read.
