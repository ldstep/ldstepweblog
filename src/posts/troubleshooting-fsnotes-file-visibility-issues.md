I recently [mentioned](https://ldstephens.net//posts/-my-small-protest-against-apple/) using FSNotes for note-taking and quick capture. However, I experienced an issue where files would randomly disappear from the user interface, only to reappear after restarting the application. I contacted the developer, who suggested I install the latest version (7.1.1) to see if it resolved the problem. I'm currently testing it.

I'm hoping this fixes the issue because I otherwise like the app as a Drafts replacement. I especially appreciate that it uses markdown files instead of a database, unlike Drafts.
