Devices, apps which should I use, and for what? Do I have to pick one and commit to it? I always feel that pressure. MacBook Pro or iPad? Drafts, Bear, MarkEdit, BBEdit, or iA Writer? Why can't I just use them all?

Here's the thing: I always force myself to stick with a single app, and I constantly struggle with which one it should be. But everything I write blog posts, journal entries, notes ends up exported to markdown files in my archive anyway. That's where it all lives. The apps are just different desks where I sit down to write. Right now, I'm writing this on my MacBook Pro in Bear. I could just as easily be doing it on my iPad, or in iA Writer, or Drafts. But this morning, Bear on the MacBook felt right, so here I am.

I've already solved the real problem, my writing isn't trapped in any app; it all ends up in the same place. So why do I keep asking myself which tool I should commit to? The answer is simple: I don't have to pick one. I can use whatever feels right. I just need to accept that that's okay.
