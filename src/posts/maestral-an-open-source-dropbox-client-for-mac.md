Dropbox has taken a lot of heat from users lately. They aren’t happy with the app that’s now part of the Dropbox install. Like me, most users would like to have the Finder integration only. That said, I only have a couple of Dropbox folders that I would like to have on my Mac but I don’t want them enough to have the new Dropbox app installed.

Last week [macosxguru](https://twitter.com/macosxguru?lang=en) mentioned [Maestral](https://github.com/SamSchott/maestral#about) in his [2020 Review](http://bicycleforyourmind.com/2020_review). Maestral is a light-weight and open-source Dropbox client for macOS and Linux. It uses the public Dropbox API and integrates with Finder just like Dropbox used to do. I’ve been using it for a few days and have had no issues.

If you’re interested in Maestral an app bundle is provided for macOS High Sierra and higher and can be [downloaded from the Releases tab](https://github.com/SamSchott/maestral/releases/tag/v1.3.1) on the Maestral GitHub page.
