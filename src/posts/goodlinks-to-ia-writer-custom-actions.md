Hey friends, as I mentioned the other day, I’m switching to [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for my blogging and writing. This means capturing my ideas directly in iA Writer. Since [GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app) is my go-to read-it-later app, I’ve created some Custom Actions that seamlessly transfer content from GoodLinks to iA Writer.

Previously, I wrote about [creating Custom Actions in GoodLinks](https://ldstephens.net/2022/12/29/how-to-create-custom-actions-in-goodlinks/) and it included actions for sending content to Drafts. I’m excited to share three Custom Actions for sending content from GoodLinks to iA Writer with you.

**Title, Author, URL, Selection to iA**

```
ia-writer://x-callback-url/new?text=[title]%0A{_}[author]{_}%0A[url]%0A[selection-text]
```

This action sends the title, author, URL, and selected text in the active article to iA Writer as plain text.

**Selection – iA**

```
ia-writer://x-callback-url/new?text=[selection-text]
```

This action sends the selected text in the active article to iA Writer as plain text.

**Markdown Title, URL – iA**

```
ia-writer://x-callback-url/new?text={[}[title]{]}{(}[url]{)}
```

This action sends the title and URL of the active article to iA Writer as markdown.
