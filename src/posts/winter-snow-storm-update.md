It's snowing and blowing, with a temperature of 24 degrees but a windchill making it feel like 10. We've already accumulated a solid 8 to 10 inches of snow. I've cleared the back porch, the roofs of the shed and chicken coop, and the cars twice already, and I need to do it again. I also used the snowblower to clear some walkways in the yard. So far, we haven't lost power, fingers crossed 🤞.
