I've often wondered if there was a way to switch between windows within the same application without using the Window menu. Fortunately, I just learned that there is!

Thanks to [Mac Geek Gab 1129 Quick Tip](https://www.macgeekgab.com/episode/1129/), I learned that you can use the keyboard shortcut Command + \` (command+backtick) to switch between open windows in an application.
