January 20, 2026

This morning, after my walk with Trix, I sat down at my MacBook, scanned my RSS feeds, and checked my email. Then I thought, "Now what?" I didn't have any special projects planned, so I decided to fool around with this site.

I have two different designs for it: one based on the 11ty base blog, and another that I built myself, which I'm pretty proud of. I decided to switch from the base blog design to the one I created. After making a few changes and updating the theme, what you're currently seeing is the result.

Hope you like it.
