I have a folder of quotes I've collected over the years. This morning, while reading through a few, one stopped me:

> Instead of constantly hunting for blog topics and maintaining a never-ending list of ideas, I'm trying a new approach. Rather than forcing ideas, I'm focusing on writing only about things that genuinely spark my interest. I'll know it's the right topic when I feel a natural urge to share my thoughts. This might mean blogging less, but it could also mean journaling more.
> 
> _Author unknown_

This quote mirrors my own approach to blogging. I don't keep a list of ideas, feel obligated to publish on a schedule, stick to specific topics, or maintain consistency. I write when something resonates with me in a way that feels worth sharing.

Often, my writing begins as a way to think, not necessarily to publish. The act of writing helps me understand the ideas I'm circling around. Sometimes that becomes a post; sometimes it doesn't, and that's fine. Not everything needs to become something.
