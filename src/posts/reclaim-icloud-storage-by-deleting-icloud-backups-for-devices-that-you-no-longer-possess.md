Today, I decided to check my iCloud storage allocation, as I’m currently subscribed to the 50 GB plan. I found that I had have consumed 31 GB out of the 50 GB available. The primary culprit was iCloud backups, which accounted for a substantial 17 GB of usage.

Upon inspecting my backups, I made an interesting discovery. There was a backup for an iPad that I no longer own, and it was using nearly 6 GB of my storage capacity. I deleted this obsolete backup, instantly reclaiming almost 6 GB of valuable storage space.

Don’t forget to regularly check and tidy up your iCloud storage to make the most of your available space.
