There is one app that is the backbone for everything that I do on my Mac. That app is [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)!

Most folks refer to Alfred as a launcher, but it is so much more. I use it for text expansion, finding files, launching apps, clipboard history, and more. No bullshit, this is the app that I use most on my Mac every single day.

The core of Alfred is free to download and use forever, with no strings attached, but if you end up liking it, you’ll want to check out the advanced features of the optional [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).

New to Alfred? Check out [Getting Started with Alfred 5](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/getting-started-with-alfred-5/).

**These are the features that I use to unlock the full power of my Mac**. Each feature listed below is a link to the documentation for that feature. To get the most out of Alfred, I highly recommend that you take the time to read about each feature.

If you’ve tried Alfred in the past and felt, that it’s the same as Spotlight, I hope this post has changed that view.
