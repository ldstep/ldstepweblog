I’ve been digging into Scott Galloway’s take on healthcare, something he talks about a lot on [Pivot](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot) and honestly, his phased Medicare expansion idea makes a lot of sense for America. He thinks the path to a national system isn’t some overnight revolution. It’s a slow rollout: cut the Medicare age by two years every two years until it covers everyone.

65 → 63 → 61 → all the way down to zero.

It’s a simple way to move to a real Medicare for All. Hospitals and insurers get time to adjust. People get coverage without waiting for Congress to agree on the perfect plan. 

I don’t agree with Scott on everything he says, but this one strikes me as both practical and humane. *Healthcare as a right*, implemented with a plan.
