February 9, 2026

This morning, I was looking for something to read and browsed the Bearblog discovery feed. While there's a lot of content there, I realized the platform wasn't quite the right fit for my site. So, I've moved back to 11ty and Render.

As I considered the move, I also took stock of my original site's archive. Much of it is outdated, full of dead links, and tied to tools and ideas I've moved past. Rather than carry all of that forward, I decided to retire the original site. [ldstephens.net](http://ldstephens.net) will now use the weblog site I'd been maintaining on the side. It's much simpler and cleaner to maintain and better reflects where I am now.

**If you followed via RSS**

With redirects set, the old feeds should still work. But just in case, you may want to subscribe to the new feed: [**https://ldstephens.net/feed.xml**](https://ldstephens.net/feed.xml)

Sorry for the confusion, and thanks for reading.
