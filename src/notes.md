Images for 11ty blog posts via GitHub + Statically CDN

Keep images out of the main site repo. Store them in a separate public GitHub repo and serve them through Statically, which resizes and converts on the fly.

**Setup**
- Created a public GitHub repo for images 
- Upload images as `.jpeg` (not `.heic` — browsers can't display HEIC natively)

**URL Template**
https://cdn.statically.io/img/gh/USER/REPO/BRANCH/FILENAME?width=800&format=webp

**Usage**
Standard Markdown — no 11ty config changes needed

I've been using Firefox instead of Safari lately. A few reasons:

It clears cookies and history on close and you can set exceptions for sites you want to stay logged into. Every site I use works in Firefox without issues. And the Bitwarden extension is solid.

That's it. No regrets.

> How Anyone Can Score Apple's Educational Discount 
> 
> According to Apple, the Education Store only applies to "current and newly accepted college students and their parents, as well as faculty, staff, and homeschool teachers of all grade levels." But this is the (open) secret of Apple's Education Store: While the discounts are supposed to be for students, educators, and parents, anyone can shop the Education Store and take advantage of the same savings. There is no proof required when accessing the Education Store online in the U.S.—it's just a different section of the Apple Store website. Once you're in, you're in, and you can get the same discounts as anyone Apple would intend the discount for.
> 
> That includes, of course, the MacBook Neo, which starts at just $499 on the Education Store (for the 256GB model).

I'm experimenting with Bear as a replacement for Drafts — for blog posts, notes, journal entries, and archive storage.

One thing I like: if I ever need to recover a specific note, I don't have to overwrite my current data. I can restore from a Bear backup by renaming the `.bear2bk` file to `.zip`, unzipping it, and pulling out individual notes as `.textbundle` files. Plain text, accessible, no drama.

M5 MacBook Pros: Fine Computers With an Asterisk

> That said, there’s an asterisk here. The M6 MacBook Pro is expected before the end of this year, and it’s rumored to be a substantial redesign with OLED displays, a touchscreen, the notch replaced by a Dynamic Island, and chips built on TSMC’s 2nm process. If even half of those rumors pan out, it will be the biggest MacBook Pro refresh in years. If you’re thinking about buying an M5, go into it with open eyes.

[Howard Oakley](https://eclecticlight.co/2026/01/27/should-you-restart-or-cold-boot/)

**Should you restart or cold boot?**

> Summary
> 
>  * Perform a cold boot by shutting down, waiting at least ten seconds, then starting up again.
>  * A cold boot may sometimes be more effective at fixing problems than a restart.
>  * If you have tried restarting your Mac to address a problem and that didn’t help, try a cold boot.
>  * Cold booting may be more effective at addressing problems with external boot disks, or possibly with other peripherals.
>  * We don’t fully understand why a cold boot might differ in effect from a restart, but it could.
>  * There is no evidence that a Mac should always, or usually, be cold-booted rather than restarted.

Helpful information to have.

[Andre Franca, Why People Should Not Ask for Donations or Money to Run Their Own Personal Blog](https://afranca.com.br/why-people-should-not-ask-for-donations-or-money-to-run-their-own-personal-blog/)

> Why do you run a blog? Is it to make a living, or is it a hobby? If you write from your small corner of the internet for pleasure, to meet new people, or simply for engagement, then you probably shouldn’t ask for money for it. Here's why:
>
> […] 
>
> First, asking for donations creates an implicit transaction, even when framed as "optional". Readers may feel entitled to certain topics, frequency, or opinions.
> 
> Second, financial incentives often (if not always) influence behavior. Writers may unconsciously avoid controversial opinions, difficult topics, or experimental ideas out of fear of alienating supporters. This certainly leads to self-censorship, where authenticity is sacrificed in favor of maintaining income. There are many examples of this among content creators out there.
> 
> Third, the barrier to entry for blogging has never been lower. Today, there are countless ways to build an online presence, and running a blog can cost little to nothing. When the costs of running a blog are minimal or nonexistent, requesting money becomes harder to justify, especially for a purely personal website.
>
> […] 
>
> Finally, without financial pressure, writers are free to write irregularly, change direction, or even stop altogether. At least, that is how I feel about this blog.

_For my own site_, I agree in principle.

A personal blog, for me, is my space where I share how I'm using my tech, random thoughts, and the occasional rant. I don't want to feel obligated to produce posts, stick to specific topics, or maintain consistency. Even optional donations can alter that dynamic, at least in my own mind.

Blogging isn't expensive anymore. A domain and basic hosting cost very little, and I'm happy to cover that expense myself.

I appreciate that my blog doesn't have to perform. It doesn't need to grow or justify its existence. It can be valuable to a few people, or just to me.

What are your thoughts?

Lately, I’ve noticed something about how and where I write. When I sit down to write on my MacBook Pro, I often miss keys or lose my place on the keyboard. I chalk that up to having short fingers. Some keys just aren’t comfortable to reach.

On my 11" iPad with the Magic Keyboard, it’s a different story. I type faster and more accurately, probably because the keyboard is more compact.

This makes it pretty clear that I should be doing most of my writing on the iPad, and using the MacBook Pro for final editing and processing.

I wrote this on my M2 iPad Air in Drafts.

[Andre Franca](https://afranca.com.br/the-saas-takeover/)

> Some days I imagined the time when I could actually buy software. Pay once, install it, use it for years, done. It looks like every tool wants to live in my credit card, and even the simplest app insists on a monthly relationship. That didn’t happen by accident. I mean, the world didn’t wake up one day and decide SaaS was more elegant. It took shape as a practical solution, and over time it became the model users were expected to accept.[…] But then comes the uncomfortable side.[…] I’ve seen products ship updates no one asked for, just to justify another email saying "we’re evolving...". I've seen softwares growing heavier, more complex, and somehow less useful, all in service of looking busy enough to deserve its monthly fee.

> [Federico](https://www.macstories.net/stories/wading-back-into-the-liquid-glass-pool-the-macstories-os-26-app-roundup-continued/): 2025 has been the year that I’ve fully embraced [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) as my Markdown text editor/notepad of choice, and that’s all thanks to AI. Let me explain: thanks to the advancements in coding for models like GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, I’ve been able to turn Drafts into a highly personalized, extensible plain text editor that – unlike Obsidian – is _natively_ integrated with Apple’s design language and latest platform features. That was never the case with Obsidian, which is an Electron app at its core and can’t match the pace of truly native apps for iOS and iPadOS. With Drafts, I get to have my cake and eat it too; I can “vibe-code” my own actions thanks to Claude, and I don’t have to give up on the nice perks that come with an application that is frequently updated for the latest Apple APIs.
> 
> […]
> 
> In a sea of so-called “opinionated” text editors that often use that adjective as an excuse for their lack of features, Drafts has managed to keep its simplicity while unlocking incredible potential for power users. If you haven’t played around with Drafts in a while, its latest updates for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS 26 are a great opportunity to test the app again.

I’ve been digging into Scott Galloway’s take on healthcare, something he talks about a lot on [Pivot](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot) and honestly, his phased Medicare expansion idea makes a lot of sense for America. He thinks the path to a national system isn’t some overnight revolution. It’s a slow rollout: cut the Medicare age by two years every two years until it covers everyone.

65 → 63 → 61 → all the way down to zero.

It’s a simple way to move to a real Medicare for All. Hospitals and insurers get time to adjust. People get coverage without waiting for Congress to agree on the perfect plan. 

I don’t agree with Scott on everything he says, but this one strikes me as both practical and humane. *Healthcare as a right*, implemented with a plan.

I was thinking this morning that maybe my setup should be Drafts and iA Writer instead of Drafts and Ulysses. I prefer keeping everything in plain text files anyway, not in proprietary databases like Drafts, Ulysses, or Bear. I could just as easily pair Drafts with Devonthink since it already indexes all my folders. And if I need a file-based editor, I’ve got BBEdit, though I already own Devonthink and iA Writer, so iA Writer could fill that role too.

The other thing that crossed my mind is that Drafts is really a text capture and processing app that can also handle writing. Ulysses and iA Writer are dedicated writing apps.

At some point I should just make a decision and quit flip-flopping. Wishful thinking ¯\_(ツ)_/

Yesterday, while working on a new post for ldstephens, I had a couple of research pieces open. I kept bouncing back and forth between what I was writing and the reference docs, clicking around way more than I wanted to. I've been doing it this way for years.

Turns out there is. Tabs. I opened each document in its own tab, and switching between them became effortless. Sometimes the simplest solutions right in front of your nose.

My first few days [using Ulysses](https://ldstephens.net/blog/back-to-ulysses/) have been an adjustment. I'm rethinking my workflow for processing blog posts and adding notes.

I've figured out the blog post part figured out. I'm enjoying writing in Ulysses and prefer the organization of using groups and folders instead of tags. I can easily drag a completed post directly into my 11ty site's post folder, which is straightforward.

The friction arises when I add a new note entry. I need the content in HTML format for the RSS feed.xml, but when Ulysses copies as HTML, all the syntax is escaped, making it messy to clean up. I'm working on a workaround for that. One option is to use PopClip's copy to HTML feature.

This is still a work in progress.

The one big tasks coming up this week is cutting logs from trees that were felled in the spring. I plan to cut the logs into 14-inch pieces, which is the ideal length for our wood burner, and then split them into firewood-sized pieces with the splitter. When all is said and done, I expect to have a cord and a half of firewood.

I'm finding the Liquid Glass UI in Drafts on the iPad a bit tricky to get used to. I don't use my iPad that much so it's not a big deal. And even at that, I do most of my writing on MacBook Pro. But as I often say, I'm faster and more accurate typing on the iPad 11" keyboard. Ya know, short fingers. 

I’ll use my iPad more for the next few days to get used its Liquid Glass UI.

My initial reaction to Drafts 48, which aims to support OS 26 for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, is negative. The loss of the Workspace Bar on iOS and iPadOS is a significant drawback for me, as it requires extra clicks or taps to perform tasks that used to be done with a single click.

> Challenges and Streaks.[…] Now let’s jump back to the blogging challenges that kind of triggered this post, I see that the more people who I usually really enjoy reading posts from write these less than lorem ipsum posts, it feels like they don’t care about writing it, they write not because they want to, but because they feel an obligation to, to not be a failure in not reaching their goal, them treating their writing more as a way of pushing out “content” than wanting to share something, or writing something they even care a little bit about makes me as a reader not care either. The insidious thing though is that this also colours their other writing, the more slop someone shares, the harder it gets for me to care as well, and the itching to just unsubscribe from something that neither the writer, nor myself really seem to care about grows.

> Choosing human-readable file formats is an act of technological sovereignty. It's about maintaining control over your data, ensuring long-term accessibility, and building systems that remain comprehensible and maintainable over time. The slight overhead of human readability pays dividends in flexibility, durability, and peace of mind. These formats also represent a philosophy: that technology should serve human understanding rather than obscure it. In choosing transparency over convenience, we build more resilient, more maintainable, and ultimately more trustworthy systems.

MarkEdit received an update today, which referenced some additional themes. I experimented with a few, but it took me some time to figure out how to use them.

---

July 24, 2025, at 8:36:43 AM

I’m always changing my mind about what writing tool I want to use.

MarkEdit is clean, file-based, and built for Markdown—great for blog posts and journal entries. It keeps me focused and fits the kind of consistent, reliable workflow I’m aiming for.

Drafts has been part of my routine for years. It’s perfect for capturing text and sending it wherever I need, even if it’s not really built for longform writing.

So for now, I’ll keep using Drafts for capture and quick notes, then move writing to MarkEdit. Since it’s Mac-only, I’ll use iA Writer or 1Writer on my iPhone and iPad.

At least, that’s the plan—until I change my mind again.

Over on weblog.ldstephens, I rebuilt the site using modified version of the 11ty base blog and added a background color. Now both blogs have the same layout.

Still not sure if I'll link to weblog.ldstephens from ldstephens. There's already a link going the other way in the nav.

Apple, of course, built it’s name on quality, so they can’t make their products bad. They need to be good enough for the prices they command, but not so good that you keep them too long.

Apple Notes on iOS 18 now has a new feature called Recent Notes. It lets you quickly jump between the last 10 notes you looked at. This makes it much easier and faster for people with lots of notes, as you don’t need to dig through all your folders.

To access this feature, tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the app. You’ll see a Recent Notes option. Tap it to view the last 10 notes you checked out.

> Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) are putting pressure on big tech firms to explain their motives for donating to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. In letters to Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Uber, the lawmakers express concerns about the companies making contributions to “avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.”

It’s the first day of Winter, and we woke up to snow this morning. About 2 inches. Knowing that it was going to snow overnight, I was curious about how Trix (our dog) would like it or if she would. She loved it. It was fun to watch her run around, jump up and down, and eat the snow.

What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data breaches directly.
