[Howard Oakley](https://eclecticlight.co/2026/01/27/should-you-restart-or-cold-boot/)

**Should you restart or cold boot?**

> Summary
> 
>  * Perform a cold boot by shutting down, waiting at least ten seconds, then starting up again.
>  * A cold boot may sometimes be more effective at fixing problems than a restart.
>  * If you have tried restarting your Mac to address a problem and that didn’t help, try a cold boot.
>  * Cold booting may be more effective at addressing problems with external boot disks, or possibly with other peripherals.
>  * We don’t fully understand why a cold boot might differ in effect from a restart, but it could.
>  * There is no evidence that a Mac should always, or usually, be cold-booted rather than restarted.

Helpful information to have.

It's snowing and blowing, with a temperature of 24 degrees but a windchill making it feel like 10. We've already accumulated a solid 8 to 10 inches of snow. I've cleared the back porch, the roofs of the shed and chicken coop, and the cars twice already, and I need to do it again. I also used the snowblower to clear some walkways in the yard. So far, we haven't lost power, fingers crossed 🤞.

[Andre Franca, Why People Should Not Ask for Donations or Money to Run Their Own Personal Blog](https://afranca.com.br/why-people-should-not-ask-for-donations-or-money-to-run-their-own-personal-blog/)

> Why do you run a blog? Is it to make a living, or is it a hobby? If you write from your small corner of the internet for pleasure, to meet new people, or simply for engagement, then you probably shouldn’t ask for money for it. Here's why:
>
> […] 
>
> First, asking for donations creates an implicit transaction, even when framed as "optional". Readers may feel entitled to certain topics, frequency, or opinions.
> 
> Second, financial incentives often (if not always) influence behavior. Writers may unconsciously avoid controversial opinions, difficult topics, or experimental ideas out of fear of alienating supporters. This certainly leads to self-censorship, where authenticity is sacrificed in favor of maintaining income. There are many examples of this among content creators out there.
> 
> Third, the barrier to entry for blogging has never been lower. Today, there are countless ways to build an online presence, and running a blog can cost little to nothing. When the costs of running a blog are minimal or nonexistent, requesting money becomes harder to justify, especially for a purely personal website.
>
> […] 
>
> Finally, without financial pressure, writers are free to write irregularly, change direction, or even stop altogether. At least, that is how I feel about this blog.

_For my own site_, I agree in principle.

A personal blog, for me, is my space where I share how I'm using my tech, random thoughts, and the occasional rant. I don't want to feel obligated to produce posts, stick to specific topics, or maintain consistency. Even optional donations can alter that dynamic, at least in my own mind.

Blogging isn't expensive anymore. A domain and basic hosting cost very little, and I'm happy to cover that expense myself.

I appreciate that my blog doesn't have to perform. It doesn't need to grow or justify its existence. It can be valuable to a few people, or just to me.

What are your thoughts?

Lately, I’ve noticed something about how and where I write. When I sit down to write on my MacBook Pro, I often miss keys or lose my place on the keyboard. I chalk that up to having short fingers. Some keys just aren’t comfortable to reach.

On my 11" iPad with the Magic Keyboard, it’s a different story. I type faster and more accurately, probably because the keyboard is more compact.

This makes it pretty clear that I should be doing most of my writing on the iPad, and using the MacBook Pro for final editing and processing.

I wrote this on my M2 iPad Air in Drafts.

[Andre Franca](https://afranca.com.br/the-saas-takeover/)

> Some days I imagined the time when I could actually buy software. Pay once, install it, use it for years, done. It looks like every tool wants to live in my credit card, and even the simplest app insists on a monthly relationship. That didn’t happen by accident. I mean, the world didn’t wake up one day and decide SaaS was more elegant. It took shape as a practical solution, and over time it became the model users were expected to accept.[…] But then comes the uncomfortable side.[…] I’ve seen products ship updates no one asked for, just to justify another email saying "we’re evolving...". I've seen softwares growing heavier, more complex, and somehow less useful, all in service of looking busy enough to deserve its monthly fee.

Interesting post by Andre. As I mentioned in my previous note, I'm eliminating my last few app subscriptions in 2026. For everything I need to accomplish on a computer, I have either a paid or free app that meets my requirements.

> [Federico](https://www.macstories.net/stories/wading-back-into-the-liquid-glass-pool-the-macstories-os-26-app-roundup-continued/): 2025 has been the year that I’ve fully embraced [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) as my Markdown text editor/notepad of choice, and that’s all thanks to AI. Let me explain: thanks to the advancements in coding for models like GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, I’ve been able to turn Drafts into a highly personalized, extensible plain text editor that – unlike Obsidian – is _natively_ integrated with Apple’s design language and latest platform features. That was never the case with Obsidian, which is an Electron app at its core and can’t match the pace of truly native apps for iOS and iPadOS. With Drafts, I get to have my cake and eat it too; I can “vibe-code” my own actions thanks to Claude, and I don’t have to give up on the nice perks that come with an application that is frequently updated for the latest Apple APIs.

> […]
> 
> In a sea of so-called “opinionated” text editors that often use that adjective as an excuse for their lack of features, Drafts has managed to keep its simplicity while unlocking incredible potential for power users. If you haven’t played around with Drafts in a while, its latest updates for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS 26 are a great opportunity to test the app again.

I’ve been digging into Scott Galloway’s take on healthcare, something he talks about a lot on [Pivot](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot) and honestly, his phased Medicare expansion idea makes a lot of sense for America. He thinks the path to a national system isn’t some overnight revolution. It’s a slow rollout: cut the Medicare age by two years every two years until it covers everyone.

65 → 63 → 61 → all the way down to zero.

It’s a simple way to move to a real Medicare for All. Hospitals and insurers get time to adjust. People get coverage without waiting for Congress to agree on the perfect plan. 

I don’t agree with Scott on everything he says, but this one strikes me as both practical and humane. *Healthcare as a right*, implemented with a plan.

I was thinking this morning that maybe my setup should be Drafts and iA Writer instead of Drafts and Ulysses. I prefer keeping everything in plain text files anyway, not in proprietary databases like Drafts, Ulysses, or Bear. I could just as easily pair Drafts with Devonthink since it already indexes all my folders. And if I need a file-based editor, I’ve got BBEdit, though I already own Devonthink and iA Writer, so iA Writer could fill that role too.

The other thing that crossed my mind is that Drafts is really a text capture and processing app that can also handle writing. Ulysses and iA Writer are dedicated writing apps.

At some point I should just make a decision and quit flip-flopping. Wishful thinking ¯\_(ツ)_/

Yesterday, while working on a new post for ldstephens, I had a couple of research pieces open. I kept bouncing back and forth between what I was writing and the reference docs, clicking around way more than I wanted to. I've been doing it this way for years.

Frustrated I said to myself, “There has to be a better way to do this.”
Turns out there is. Tabs. I opened each document in its own tab, and switching between them became effortless. Sometimes the simplest solutions right in front of your nose.

My first few days [using Ulysses](https://ldstephens.net/blog/back-to-ulysses/) have been an adjustment. I'm rethinking my workflow for processing blog posts and adding notes.

I've figured out the blog post part figured out. I'm enjoying writing in Ulysses and prefer the organization of using groups and folders instead of tags. I can easily drag a completed post directly into my 11ty site's post folder, which is straightforward.

The friction arises when I add a new note entry. I need the content in HTML format for the RSS feed.xml, but when Ulysses copies as HTML, all the syntax is escaped, making it messy to clean up. I'm working on a workaround for that. One option is to use PopClip's copy to HTML feature.

This is still a work in progress.

It's been in the 30s the last few mornings here in central New Jersey. We're close to peak fall color. This afternoon I'm going to mow the grass for what will be the last time until next spring. Of course, I use it along with the leaf blower to clean up all the leaves that are starting to fall.

The one big tasks coming up this week is cutting logs from trees that were felled in the spring. I plan to cut the logs into 14-inch pieces, which is the ideal length for our wood burner, and then split them into firewood-sized pieces with the splitter. When all is said and done, I expect to have a cord and a half of firewood.

> Challenges and Streaks.[…] Now let’s jump back to the blogging challenges that kind of triggered this post, I see that the more people who I usually really enjoy reading posts from write these less than lorem ipsum posts, it feels like they don’t care about writing it, they write not because they want to, but because they feel an obligation to, to not be a failure in not reaching their goal, them treating their writing more as a way of pushing out “content” than wanting to share something, or writing something they even care a little bit about makes me as a reader not care either. The insidious thing though is that this also colours their other writing, the more slop someone shares, the harder it gets for me to care as well, and the itching to just unsubscribe from something that neither the writer, nor myself really seem to care about grows.

> Choosing human-readable file formats is an act of technological sovereignty. It's about maintaining control over your data, ensuring long-term accessibility, and building systems that remain comprehensible and maintainable over time. The slight overhead of human readability pays dividends in flexibility, durability, and peace of mind. These formats also represent a philosophy: that technology should serve human understanding rather than obscure it. In choosing transparency over convenience, we build more resilient, more maintainable, and ultimately more trustworthy systems.

I wish I had kept a record of all the books I’ve read. Now that I’m reading again, I can’t recall which books from my favorite authors I’ve read and haven’t read.

I read samples of books before buying, and quite frequently, I find myself thinking I’ve read that before.

MarkEdit received an update today, which referenced some additional themes. I experimented with a few, but it took me some time to figure out how to use them. Interestingly, adding one of them didn’t add it to the list of themes in MarkEdit Settings. Instead, it’s an extension that allows for editor customization and overrides the built-in themes.

I installed iA Writer on my MacBook again. We’ll see how long it lasts?

---

July 24, 2025, at 8:36:43 AM

I’m always changing my mind about what writing tool I want to use.

MarkEdit is clean, file-based, and built for Markdown—great for blog posts and journal entries. It keeps me focused and fits the kind of consistent, reliable workflow I’m aiming for.

Drafts has been part of my routine for years. It’s perfect for capturing text and sending it wherever I need, even if it’s not really built for longform writing.

So for now, I’ll keep using Drafts for capture and quick notes, then move writing to MarkEdit. Since it’s Mac-only, I’ll use iA Writer or 1Writer on my iPhone and iPad.

At least, that’s the plan—until I change my mind again.

I was fiddling with my blogs today and made a few updates.

On ldstephens, I moved the slash pages out of the About page and into the main navigation. I also took out the link to the weblog.

Over on weblog.ldstephens, I rebuilt the site using modified version of the 11ty base blog and added a background color. Now both blogs have the same layout.

Still not sure if I'll link to weblog.ldstephens from ldstephens. There's already a link going the other way in the nav.

---

However, there’s nothing like Day One for dealing with photos, geolocation, and resurfacing past entries with the “On This Day” feature. Plus, mobile. So I’ve continued using Org-journal, but at the end of each month, I import the entries into Day One.

[Jack Baty](https://baty.net/posts/2025/07/duplication/)

I do something similar, but instead of using Emacs, I use Drafts. Drafts has a nice [Monthly Journal Action](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-journaling-in-drafts/5803). Throughout the month, I write journal entries in Drafts, and then at the end of the month, I have an action that sends the Monthly Journal to Day One.

I’m thinking about how I search for and open documents. I have to start a search query somewhere—whether that’s Alfred, Drafts, DEVONthink, Finder, or HoudahSpot—and then I still have to open the document. With that in mind, there’s no real advantage to keeping all my archived documents in Drafts, since I can just as easily search for and open them with any of the other tools in my preferred Markdown editor.

> All of this is to point out that a loss of trust in society — trust in government, trust in institutions, trust in each other — is the cause of a break down and, if left uncorrected, end to that society. Period. There is no “but”. You can not have a society without it. Society rises and falls on the strength of it.

> I’ll start sounding like a broken record but, at this point, I don’t care: social media was and still is a mistake. Enough people all bunched together in the same space with the ability to quickly interact with each other will produce more harm than good. And no, decentralising this crap won’t make it better. You can lie to yourself and pretend it will, but it won’t. But hey, I’ll be happy to be proven wrong.

It snowed here again last night and it’s fucking cold. As I write this, it’s about time to take Trix out for her afternoon walk and it’s only 25° and feels like 13°. We have three more days of this Arctic weather. I like the cold weather. Getting all bundled up in layers of my winter clothes.

I detest posting political content on my blog, but this certainly falls under the tech category.

Emma Roth

> Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) are putting pressure on big tech firms to explain their motives for donating to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. In letters to Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Uber, the lawmakers express concerns about the companies making contributions to “avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.”

I think they call it kissing ass!

Ops! It’s my 80th Birthday today!

I’m thinking about where I write blog posts. I usually do it in Drafts, but sometimes I think I should do it in iA Writer instead. It’s a more distraction-free environment.

This morning, I got out early for my walk, hoping to beat the start of the snowstorm that’s bearing down on us. Well, I almost got it finished before the snow started falling.

After my fall down the basement stairs the other day, I decided that I need to work on improving my balance. Falling is problem when you’re a senior. Lisa encouraged me to start doing yoga. Today was my first workout. It made me realize how shitty my balance is!

It’s on my mind again–the constant battle between my MacBook and iPad. Why can’t I just accept that I can use both? I can pick whichever one suits me in the moment. There’s no need to choose just one or the other.

It’s the first day of Winter, and we woke up to snow this morning. About 2 inches. Knowing that it was going to snow overnight, I was curious about how Trix (our dog) would like it or if she would. She loved it. It was fun to watch her run around, jump up and down, and eat the snow.

🌤 Current Weather: 29°F and Windy

My tech stack plan for 2025 is files over apps and to use non-subscription apps where possible.

> File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.
>
> File over app is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.

[File over app — Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately.

What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data breaches directly.

> Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my “audience” feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?\[…\] I don’t get a lot of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or influence or popularity. I write to better understand my thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.\[…\] In that light, I shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places. I don’t want to be a dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let’s not overthink it.
