<p>Emily Peck,<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/social-security-lutnick-doge-checks"> writing for Axios</a>: Seniors won't complain if they miss a Social Security check, Lutnick says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick suggested this week that only &quot;fraudsters&quot; would complain about missing a monthly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/20/doge-social-security-deposit-fraud">Social Security</a> check, and that most people wouldn't mind if the government simply skipped a payment.[…] More than 70 million Americans get a Social Security benefit every month, and for many, those checks are their only income.[…] &quot;Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain,&quot; Lutnick — a billionaire former Wall Street CEO — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=182ckTL2KBA">told</a> the billionaire &quot;All In&quot; podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of shit just makes my fucking blood boil. As many of you know you know I’m 80 years old. I depend on my monthly Social Security check to live. Would I miss a check? Hell yes! So would millions of other seniors Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and those who don’t give a shit about politics. For some, it’s their <em>only</em> source of income.</p>
<p>It’s not like we’re getting a freebie here. We all paid into Social Security and Medicare our entire working lives. I started working when I was 15 years old and was never without a job until I retired. So I paid my fucking dues and so did all other seniors.</p>
<p>Oh, but sure, let's just skip a payment, what could possibly go wrong? Maybe Lutnick thinks we can all just hop on our yachts and ride out the month, or maybe we should start selling off our prescription meds to make rent. The sheer arrogance of a billionaire pretending he knows what it's like to rely on Social Security is bullshit. News flash: We're not asking for a favor. We're demanding what we <em>earned</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe you can tell I’m pissed. <em>Don’t fuck with our Social Security and Medicare!</em></p>
