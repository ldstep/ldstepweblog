<p>&quot;Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you write: write in spoken language.[…] It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language. So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask &quot;Is this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?&quot; If it isn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead. After a while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write something you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the page.[…] just don't let a sentence through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.&quot;</p>
