<p>Hey friends, let's talk social media. It's been around forever, and you know what? I gotta confess, I've never been a huge fan. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat – I’ve never had an account on any of them.</p>
<p>The closest I came was Twitter. Used to have it on and off, mainly to keep up with current events. But after that whole thing with the shitposter buying XTwitter I said fuck this and deleted my account for good.</p>
<p>For a while now, I've been on Mastodon. It's a different platform, but honestly? Here's the thing: everyone I follow there also has a blog with an RSS feed that follow. And guess what? The stuff I see on Mastodon is the same stuff I’ve already seen in those feeds. There's some occasional back-and-forth but for conversations I much prefer email. You can always reach me through my blog if you ever want to chat.</p>
<p>Anyway, after a lot of thinking, I've decided to ditch Mastodon too. Social media, just ain't my thing. I'll still be here on the blog, creating and sharing my thoughts. Just minus the social media.</p>
