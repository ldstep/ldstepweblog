<p>I don’t know who reads this. I don’t know how they find it. I don’t know if they’ll ever come back. I don’t know a damned thing. And that’s by design. I value my privacy and by extension, I value others’. That’s exactly why I don’t have newsletters. The last thing I want is someone’s email.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>This blog is a place to get things out of my head. I write for myself. Putting it on display provides just enough social pressure to give it <em>that much more</em> care. But it’d be fine if it was read by no one. I won’t lie–that wasn’t always the case. It took me a lot of years to grind that desire out of me.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Many folks got caught in the trap that they <em>just might</em> be able to make a living by making content. And just like every other road to fame, 99.9% of them didn’t.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I’ll never grow a following or make a dime from this blog. That’s just fine. It keeps things clean and easy. I have a simple site that I pay nothing to host. I have no aspirations beyond what this currently is. I write the things I want to write. People may read it. If they do, awesome. If they don’t, whatever. It’s freeing.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>But who cares about how I feel. More importantly, this approach respects readers. They’re not tracked. They’re not bothered with ads. There are no stupid GDPR labyrinths. None of their personal information is stored. They come, they read, they leave. That’s it.</p>

<p>I always find it enjoyable to read others' perspectives on blogs and blogging.</p>
